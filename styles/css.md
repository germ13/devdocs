inline elements cannot be given width nor height

margin can be applied to inline elements, but it will only affect the side (right and left) not top and bottom.

margin on block element will affect every side trbl

the same is true with padding as it is with margin.

----------------------------

* positioning

** absolute

*** block element

- no longer will span the entire width of container or viewport
- above rule, assuming parent element has no positioning
- if it does, the absolute position is relative to parent element
- the width of the element will be what is necessary.
- the elements after and before will not be aware of the space being taken up by element.
- will be on top of other elements
-
