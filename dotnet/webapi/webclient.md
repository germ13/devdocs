# WebClient

The `WebClient` class provides common methods for sending data to or receiving data from any local, intranet, or internert resource identified by an URI.

It supports URIs:
-  `http:`
-  `https:`
-  `ftp:`
-  `file:`

A `WebClient` instance does not supply HTTP headers by default.  These must be added.
